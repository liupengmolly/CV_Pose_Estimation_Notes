    "1. ** Ambiguities due to the unconstrainedd \"in the wild\" imagess **\n",
    "2. 一些传统方法：\n",
    "    * Face Detection: scanning window classifiers,\n",
    "    * Pos Estimation: view-based eigenspace methods\n",
    "    * Faciel landmark estimation: elastic graph models. global spatial models built on top of local part detectors(Known as Constrained Local Models)\n",
    "3. **The model based on a mixture of tree-structured part and max-margin models**  \n",
    "    * define a \"part\" at each facial landmark and use global mixtures to modle topological changes due to viewpoint;\n",
    "    * a part will only be visible in certain mixtrues/views, but different mixtures could share part templates.\n",
