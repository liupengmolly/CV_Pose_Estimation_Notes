    "to detect the locations of K keypoints or parts, generally transform the problem to estimating K heatmaps of size WxH,$\\{H_1,H_2,...,H_k\\}$, where each heatmap $H_k$ indicate the feature map of the kth keypoint.\n",

    "contains four stages with four parallel subnetworks, \n",
    "The first stage contains 4 residual units where each unit, the same to the ResNet-50, is formed by a bottleneck with the width 64, and is followed by one 3×3 convolution reducing the width of feature maps to C.      \n",
    "The 2nd, 3rd, 4th stages contain 1, 4, 3 exchange blocks, respectively. One exchange block contains 4 residual units where each unit contains two 3 × 3 convolutions in each resolution and an exchange unit across resolutions."
