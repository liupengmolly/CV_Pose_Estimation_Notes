    "To resolve the challenges share with 2D and the 3D pose rescovery from monocular imagery,  a prefereable way is  to investigate how to simultaneously ** enforce 2D spatial relationship, 3D geometry constraint and temporal consistency within one single model**.    \n",
    "Inspired by the pose machine and CPM, our RPSM proposes a multi-stage training to capture long-range dependencies among multiple body-parts for 3d pose prediction.     \n",
    "Also include several stage, in each stage, RPSM is composed by **a 2D pose module**, **a feature adaption module** and **a 3D pose recurrent module**.     \n",
